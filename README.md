# Wire Path Optimization Project
 
Hours are lost during the harness manucaturing period from manually laying the wires out on previous cars for measurement. This program takes an input of the car's chassis in spreadsheet form and a list of desired start and end nodes and generates the most efficient path for the wire to follow.
